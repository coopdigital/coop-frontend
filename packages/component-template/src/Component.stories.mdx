# Example Component
This package can be used as a starter for new foundations, elements or components.

If you're starting a new component please make sure you have gone through the following checks before starting:
- Steps for component creation - component lounge and design system

After you've confirmed there is a need for the component following the steps above.  Copy and paste the package within the `./packages` directory.
Rename the the pasted directory and its files to the (element|component) you are creating.

## Usage
Usage guidelines for the blockquote component.

## Default Component Example
A test canvas to show the component and it's underlying code.
A canvas can include stories or just plain components like the one below.
<!-- Canvas -->
<Canvas>
  <Component heading="A heading" content="This is an example Component you can copy from to create your own components"></Component>
</Canvas>

## Stories for the Component component
We can keep component stories at the bottom of the documentation pages, for better doc readability.

### A default Component
A default Component story looks like this....
<!-- Story
A canvas is created for each story,
Each story "name" shows up within the storybook nav under our named Meta "title" nav item
Stories can take args the same as the Meta tag, however Story args will override Meta args.
Stories can also take decorators or parameters, adding these <Story> tag level will override <Meta>
Create stories for each state, variant of your component.
 -->
<Story name="Basic ExampleComponent"
  args= {{
    heading: "Heading from args in story",
    content: `<p>A paragraph tag with some descriptive text</p>`
  }}
>
  { BaseComponent.bind({}) }
</Story>


<Story name="Another ExampleComponent"
  args= {{
    heading: "Starter component",
    content: `Use this package as a starter for new foundation, element or component creation.`
  }}
>
  { BaseComponent.bind({}) }
</Story>



<Story name="Yet Another ExampleComponent"
  args= {{
    className: "coop-t-h2",
    heading: "An example with class name from foundations/typography",
    content: "An example using class name `coop-t-h2` from foundations/typography css set globally in this project!",
  }}
>
  { BaseComponent.bind({}) }
</Story>
