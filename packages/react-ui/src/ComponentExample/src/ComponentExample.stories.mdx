      Description: Configure a number of properties on your stories at a global level.  Add decorators, parameters, args, controls
      2 properties are required for your story in Meta.
       - `title`, depending on your react component the title will start with either Foundations, Elements or Components.  Followed by your react component name e.g. title="Components/Blockquote"
       - component:  The imported react component you are creating stories for.

       optional 'decorators', 'parameters', 'args'

<Meta

    design: {
      type: "figma",

# Example Component

This package can be used as a starter for new foundations, elements or components.

If you're starting a new component please make sure you have gone through the following checks before starting:

- Steps for component creation - component lounge and design system

After you've confirmed there is a need for the component following the steps above. Copy and paste the package within the `./packages` directory.
Rename the the pasted directory and its files to the (element|component) you are creating.

## Usage

Usage guidelines for the blockquote component.

## Default Component Example

A test canvas to show the component and it's underlying code.
A canvas can include stories or just plain components like the one below.

<!-- Canvas -->

<Canvas>
  <Component
    heading="A heading"
    content="This is an example Component you can copy from to create your own components"
  ></Component>
</Canvas>

## Stories for the Component component

We can keep component stories at the bottom of the documentation pages, for better doc readability.

### A default Component

A default Component story looks like this....

<!-- Story
A canvas is created for each story,
Each story "name" shows up within the storybook nav under our named Meta "title" nav item
Stories can take args the same as the Meta tag, however Story args will override Meta args.
Stories can also take decorators or parameters, adding these <Story> tag level will override <Meta>
Create stories for each state, variant of your component.
 -->

<Story
  name="Basic ComponentExample"
  args={{
    heading: "Heading from args in story",
    content: `some descriptive text`,
  }}
>
  {BaseComponent.bind({})}
</Story>

<Story
  name="Another ComponentExample"
  args={{
    heading: "Starter component",
    content: `Use this package as a starter for new react component creation.`,
  }}
>
  {BaseComponent.bind({})}
</Story>

<Story
  name="Yet Another ComponentExample"
  args={{
    heading: "An example with heading passed from the heading prop",
    content: "An text block passed from the content prop",
  }}
>
  {BaseComponent.bind({})}
</Story>
