# Blockquotes

Intro to blockquotes

## Usage

Usage guidelines for the blockquote component.

## Default Blockquote Example

A test canvas to show the component and it's underlying code.
A canvas can include stories or just plain components like the one below.

<Canvas>
  <Blockquote quote="This is a quote" citation="citation"></Blockquote>
</Canvas>

## Stories for the Blockquote component

We can keep component stories at the bottom of the documentation pages, for better doc readability.

### A default Blockquote

A default Blockquote looks like this....

<Story
  name="Blockquote Basic"
  args={{
    quote: "Here is a quote passed from args",
    citation: "citation",
  }}
>
  {BaseBlockquote.bind({})}
</Story>

### A Blockquote with large quote text from `quoteLarge` prop.

You can pass a variant prop of quoteLarge to the components which will modify styles of the quote.

This will not change the citation styles

<Story
  name="Blockquote with quoteLarge variant"
  args={{
    quote: "We use the quoteLarge prop to create a large quote variant",
    citation: "citation example",
    quoteLarge: true,
  }}
>
  {BaseBlockquote.bind({})}
</Story>
