# component-squircles
Co-op's squircles (half way between a aquare and a circle) are the shape of the centre of the Co-op logo's 'o'. We use it to draw a person's attention to a particular part of the page like an offer or something new.

## Installation
Install via `npm` or Yarn:
```bash
$ npm install @coopdigital/component-squircles--save
# OR
$ yarn add @coopdigital/component-squircles
```

## Usage
You can include `component-squircles` in your project by referencing it from your existing CSS via `@import` statement, i.e.:
```css
@import "node_modules/@coopdigital/component-squircles/dist/squircles.css";
```

If you use PostCSS in your build pipeline, you can reference the sources directly like so:
```css
@import "node_modules/@coopdigital/component-squircles/src/squircles.pcss";
```

If you use a `postcss-import` plugin, it gets even easier:
```css
@import "@coopdigital/component-squircles";
```

## Examples
Here's a bunch of examples, showing how you can integrate this CSS module in your project, based on most popular stacks of project. You can either use a post-processed and pre-built CSS form the `dist` directory, ot use PostCSS sources from the `src` dir.

The latter have certain dependencies, which should be consumed by your frontend toolkit to postprocess the CSS correctly.
