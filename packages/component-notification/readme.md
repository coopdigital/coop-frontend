# Component notification

## Installation
Install via `npm`:
```bash
$ npm install @coopdigital/component-card --save
```

## Usage
You can include `component-notification` in your project by referencing it from your existing CSS via `@import` statement, i.e.:
```css
@import "node_modules/@coopdigital/component-notification/dist/notification.css";
```

If you use PostCSS in your build pipeline, you can reference the sources directly like so:
```css
@import "node_modules/@coopdigital/component-notification/src/notification.css";
```

If you use a `postcss-import` plugin, it gets even easier:
```css
@import "@coopdigital/component-notification";
```

## Examples
Here's a bunch of examples, showing how you can integrate this CSS module in your project, based on most popular stacks of project. You can either use a post-processed and pre-built CSS form the `dist` directory, ot use PostCSS sources from the `src` dir.

The latter have certain dependencies, which should be consumed by your frontend toolkit to postprocess the CSS correctly.
