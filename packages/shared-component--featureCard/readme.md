# Component: Feature card
Feature cards are like Editorial cards but are combined with a squircle to highlight a deal. 

The `scr` folder contains the unprocessed `.pcss` and Jinja2 template needed for use as a shared component in contentful.

The `dist` folder contains the outputted `.css` and static `HTML` that can be integrated into any project.
