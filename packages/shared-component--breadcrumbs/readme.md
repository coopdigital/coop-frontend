# Breadcrumbs
Breadcrumbs are used for SEO and to provide users with a means of navigating from child pages to parent pages.

The `src` folder contains the unprocessed `.pcss` and Jinja2 template needed for use in your tenant theme. This component is driven only by page data and not directly configurable through Contentful.

The `dist` folder contains the outputted `.css` and static `HTML` that can be integrated into any project.

## Install
`npm i @coopdigital/shared-component--breadcrumbs`
