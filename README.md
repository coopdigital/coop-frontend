# Co-op Front-end

A mono-repository containing the design system website and foundations and component packages needed for designing and building digital services for the Coâ€‘op. All packages can be found in the [packages](./packages) directory.

## Co-op Design system

The [design system](http://coop.co.uk/designsystem) is a sub folder of this repo and can be run locally and deployed to Heroku independently of the foundations and component packages.

[How to install, run and deploy the design system](https://github.com/coopdigital/coop-frontend/blob/master/design-system/README.md)

## Developing foundation and component packages for the design system

This repository uses [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) to automatically manage versioning of all the different packages. These are published as separate packages to [Co-op digital's NPM organisation](https://www.npmjs.com/org/coopdigital). These packages can be installed by digital teams as required as dependencies of their project.

## Letting people know about changes

If you publish a new or amended component - create a release for the coop-frontend repo adding release notes to let everyone know what changes you have made and why.

The Slack github integration will let everyone on the #frontend and #designsystem channels know that there has been an update.

## Storybook react-ui package

Storybook allows you to create and update react components within the `./packages/react-ui` directory, using existing css and utility packages.

The Storybook `react-ui` package is for documentation only. The components within the react-ui package are not currently distributed.

The package is ignored by lerna so you will to install dependencies and run storybook within the packages/react-ui directory.

### **How to install, run and deploy the Co-op react storybook**

To run storybook locally, run the following commands:

- `cd packages/react-ui`
- `npm ci`
- `npm run storybook`

Storybook should now be available at `http://localhost:6006`

**_More details for setting up, running Storybook and creating components can be found [here](https://github.com/coopdigital/coop-frontend/blob/master/packages/react-ui/readme.md)_**
